Some data analysis projects I have done
## MACD-Based Technical Signal Backtesting System
Evaluated MACD(12,26,9) signals on SSE/SZSE indices (1990–2022). Found SSE golden crosses yield +0.48% avg 5-day return (48.89% win rate, P/L ratio=1.39), while SZSE signals show no edge. Built full Python pipeline for signal detection, backtesting, and financial visualization.
